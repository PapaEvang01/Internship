Introduction

The Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network is a special type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)
designed to process and forecast time series and other sequential data. By solving the
"short-term memory" limitation of classic RNNs, LSTM is well-suited for learning long-term
dependencies and capturing seasonal or periodic patterns.

In the context of Cooling Load forecasting, an LSTM model can learn:
- How current energy consumption depends on past behavior
- Complex nonlinear relationships and hidden seasonal structures
- To generate accurate forecasts even when limited external variables are available

Theoretical Basis

The LSTM architecture is based on unique internal cell blocks that manage information flow.
Each LSTM unit includes:

- Cell State (C): Carries long-term information across time steps
- Gates:
  - Forget Gate (f): Determines what information should be discarded
  - Input Gate (i): Decides which new values should be stored in memory
  - Output Gate (o): Controls what part of the memory is used to generate output

These gates interact through well-defined mathematical operations that allow the LSTM
to retain important information over long periods and discard irrelevant short-term noise.

Advantages and Limitations

Advantages:
- Capable of capturing long-term dependencies
- Handles nonlinear and seasonal patterns effectively
- Performs well in time series forecasting problems
- More resistant to overfitting compared to standard RNNs

Limitations:
- Higher computational requirements
- Requires larger datasets for reliable training
- More complex to implement and tune
- Training time is typically longer than simpler models
