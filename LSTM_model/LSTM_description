LSTM Model â€“ Forecasting Critical Energy Loads (December 2023)

This folder contains a complete implementation of an LSTM-based deep learning model
for forecasting electricity consumption in three types of critical loads:

- Very Critical Loads
- Medium Critical Loads
- Low Critical Loads

The objective is to train a neural network that learns historical load patterns
from January to November 2023 and predicts the consumption for December 2023.

Input Data:
- File: RnD_CriticalLoadHistory_2023.xlsx (same dataset as used in SARIMA)
- Time resolution: 15-minute intervals
- Features: Timestamp + three load series (very, medium, low critical)
- Data preprocessing includes normalization and reshaping into sequences for training

Model Overview:
- Architecture: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network built with PyTorch
- Input: Sequential windows of past load values
- Output: Predicted load values for the next time step(s)
- Each load category is modeled independently

Outputs:
- CSV files with actual and predicted values for December
- Plot images comparing LSTM forecasts vs actual data
- Trained model saved as a PyTorch checkpoint file (lstm_model.pth)
- Printed evaluation metrics (e.g., MAE, RMSE)

This folder is part of a larger forecasting project comparing classical time series methods (SARIMA)
with deep learning techniques (LSTM) for short-term energy prediction.
