LSTM Forecasting Results – Cooling Loads (December 2023)

This report summarizes the results of the LSTM-based model for predicting daily cooling energy loads using time series data from January to December 2023 (15-minute intervals).

Model Workflow Summary:
- The script loads the full-year Excel dataset (35,040 records)
- Splits the data into training (first 32065 records) and testing (last 2975 records for December)
- Applies Min-Max normalization
- Creates input sequences for the LSTM using past timesteps
- Trains the model for 20 epochs using a zero-sensitive loss function
- Saves the trained model (cooling_lstm_fullmodel.pth)
- Predicts the entire month of December and evaluates results using multiple metrics

Final Evaluation Metrics (on unnormalized kWh values):

- Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 0.065 kWh  
  → On average, predictions deviate by just 0.065 kWh from actual values. Very accurate.

- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): 0.167 kWh  
  → Indicates low overall error variance — the model is stable across the test set.

- R-squared Score (R²): 0.938  
  → The model explains 93.8% of the variance in actual cooling load values — excellent performance for time series forecasting.

Commentary on Cooling Load Forecasting:
- The LSTM model successfully captures both short-term and long-term patterns in the cooling load signal.
- It can generalize the daily/weekly dependencies effectively, even without external input features (e.g., weather).
- If temperature or humidity data were available, the model could be further improved with multivariate inputs.
- The goal of achieving RMSE < 2 kWh is clearly met.

Model Performance Notes:
- The training process shows consistent loss reduction and convergence over 20 epochs.
- All evaluation metrics (except MAPE) confirm high model accuracy.
- MAPE is distorted due to division by small values — to fix this, exclude time steps with ground truth < 0.1 kWh before computing percentage error.

Conclusion:
The LSTM model demonstrates strong forecasting capability for seasonal energy time series with minimal noise and consistent behavior. 
The achieved accuracy (MAE = 0.065, R² = 0.938) confirms that the model captures the underlying structure of cooling loads effectively.
