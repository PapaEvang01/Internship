Dataset Description – Critical Load Forecasting (2023)

File: RnD_CriticalLoadHistory_2023.xlsx
Format: Excel file (.xlsx)
Resolution: 15-minute intervals
Period: January 1, 2023 to December 31, 2023
Total entries: 35,040 rows (96 intervals × 365 days)

Columns:
1. Timestamp
   - Format: MM/DD/YY HH:MM
   - Example: 1/1/23 0:00, 1/1/23 0:15, ...
   - Represents the start time of each 15-minute interval

2. Very Critical Loads
   - Unit: kilowatt-hours (kWh)
   - Description: High-priority energy loads (e.g., essential infrastructure)

3. Medium Critical Loads
   - Unit: kilowatt-hours (kWh)
   - Description: Medium-priority loads (e.g., office systems, support)

4. Low Critical Loads
   - Unit: kilowatt-hours (kWh)
   - Description: Auxiliary or less time-sensitive systems

Notes:
- The second row of the Excel file contains unit labels ("kWh") and should be skipped during loading.
- Decimal values use a comma as the separator (e.g., "0,15") and must be converted to dot notation ("0.15") in Python.
- Time series data is univariate per load type (i.e., three independent series).
- Used for SARIMA and LSTM forecasting models in the internship project.
