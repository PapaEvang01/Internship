Evaluation Metrics:

Evaluating forecast for Very Critical Loads...
MAE:  0.0075 kWh  
RMSE: 0.0087 kWh  

Evaluating forecast for Medium Critical Loads...
MAE:  0.0074 kWh  
RMSE: 0.0086 kWh  

Evaluating forecast for Low Critical Loads...
MAE:  0.0075 kWh  
RMSE: 0.0087 kWh  

Interpretation (per load category):

1. Very Critical Loads:
   The SARIMA model predicts nearly perfectly due to the stable, repetitive patterns.

2. Medium Critical Loads:
   Equally accurate, with only minor deviations during peak demand periods.

3. Low Critical Loads:
   Very good model fit overall — deviations are minimal and within expected bounds.
