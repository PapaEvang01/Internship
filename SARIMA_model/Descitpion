SARIMA Forecasting – Critical Load Prediction (2023)

This folder contains a complete implementation of SARIMA-based forecasting for energy consumption, applied to three categories of critical electrical loads:

Very Critical Loads

Medium Critical Loads

Low Critical Loads

Forecasts are generated specifically for December 2023 using 15-minute resolution time series data for the full year.

Dataset
The data is stored in a file named RnD_CriticalLoadHistory_2023.xlsx (not included in this folder).
Columns used:

Very Critical Loads

Medium Critical Loads

Low Critical Loads

Time range: January to December 2023
Sampling interval: every 15 minutes

Forecasting Method

Stationarity tested using the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test

ACF and PACF plots used to estimate SARIMA parameters

Forecasting performed using the SARIMAX class from statsmodels

One SARIMA model trained per load category

Forecast horizon: December 2023
