SARIMA – Forecasting Critical Loads (December 2023)

This folder contains the full implementation of a SARIMA-based forecasting model
used to predict electricity consumption for the following three categories:

- Very Critical Loads
- Medium Critical Loads
- Low Critical Loads

The model uses 15-minute resolution time series data for the year 2023 and produces
forecasts specifically for December 2023.
